## **Description**

The **ZombieKillMessage** mod is a dedicated client-side resource for your Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas server, designed to provide immediate and visually distinct **notifications to players whenever a zombie is killed**. This enhances the feedback loop for players, making combat more engaging and satisfying by clearly acknowledging successful zombie eliminations.

In your intense zombie apocalypse server, clear and concise feedback is crucial. This mod ensures that players are instantly aware of their impact on the zombie population, potentially showing who killed which zombie and providing a sense of accomplishment, and contributing to a more immersive combat experience.

## **Features**

* **Real-time Kill Notifications:** Displays a message in chat or on the screen immediately when a zombie is killed.
* **Customizable Message Format:** Allows for unique text, colors, and possibly player/zombie names in the kill message.
* **Engaging Combat Feedback:** Enhances player satisfaction by clearly acknowledging successful zombie eliminations.
* **Lightweight & Efficient:** Designed to run smoothly without impacting server or client performance.
* **Player Identification (Optional):** May indicate which player performed the kill.

## **Technologies Used**

The **ZombieKillMessage** mod is developed using:

* **Lua:** The lightweight, powerful, multi-paradigm scripting language widely used for game development and the core scripting language for Multi Theft Auto.
* **MTA Client-Side & Server-Side Events:** Utilizes MTA's event system to detect zombie deaths on the server and trigger message display on clients.

## **Installation Guide**

To install the **ZombieKillMessage** mod on your Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas server, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Release Package:**

    * Download the latest release package of your full mod pack from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Maniseniler/PackZombieMTA/releases) section of your GitHub repository.

    * The **ZombieKillMessage** mod resource folder is included within this **.zip** file.

2.  **Extract the Mod Files:**

    * Unzip the downloaded **.zip** file to access its contents.

    * Locate the **ZombieKillMessage** folder among the extracted resource directories.

3.  **Place Resource on Your Server:**

    * Copy *only* the **ZombieKillMessage** resource folder directly into your MTA server's **resources** directory.

    * *Typical path:* `C:\Multi Theft Auto\Server\mods\deathmatch\resources\`

4.  **Configure `mtaserver.conf` (Recommended for Auto-Startup):**

    * Open your server's **mtaserver.conf** file, which is usually found in your server's root directory (e.g., `C:\Multi Theft Auto\Server\mods\deathmatch\mtaserver.conf`).

    * To ensure the **ZombieKillMessage** mod starts automatically every time your server launches, add the following line within the **<server>** tags:

        ```xml
        <resource src="ZombieKillMessage" startup="1" protected="0" />
        ```

    * Alternatively, you can manually start the resource in the MTA server console after startup by typing: **`start ZombieKillMessage`**.

5.  **Configure ZombieKillMessage Mod Settings (Optional):**

    * Check the **ZombieKillMessage** folder for a configuration file (e.g., `config.lua` or `settings.xml`). This file might allow you to customize the message's appearance and content.

    * If a config file exists, you may be able to adjust settings such as:
        * `messageText`: The template for the kill message (e.g., "PlayerName killed a Zombie!").
        * `messageColor`: The color of the kill message in chat.
        * `displayMethod`: Whether the message appears in standard chat, a custom GUI, or both.

6.  **Configure ACL (Access Control List) - (Generally Not Required):**

    * The **ZombieKillMessage** mod is primarily a passive notification system. It generally does *not* require specific ACL entries for players to use it, as its function is to automatically display messages based on gameplay events.
    * If your **ZombieKillMessage** mod includes any administrative commands (e.g., to toggle kill messages globally, or for debug purposes), those commands would need corresponding ACL entries for admin groups.
    * **Check the `ZombieKillMessage` mod's server-side Lua files and `meta.xml` for any defined commands or functions that require permissions.**
    * Your provided `acl.xml` lists `resource.D1_ZombieKillMessage` under the `Admin` group, which is good for general control over the resource itself.
    * Refer to the official [MTA Wiki on ACL](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/ACL) for detailed guidance on how to modify your **acl.xml**.

7.  **Start Your MTA Server:**

    * Launch your Multi Theft Auto server.

    * The **ZombieKillMessage** mod should now be active, providing satisfying notifications for every zombie kill!
