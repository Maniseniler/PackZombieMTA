Alternatively, you can manually start the resource in the MTA server console after startup using the command: start AFK.Configure AFK Mod Settings (Optional - if applicable):The AFK mod may include a configuration file (e.g., config.lua or a section within meta.xml) where you can adjust settings like:afkTimeout: The number of seconds of inactivity before a player is marked AFK.kickAfterAFK: true or false to enable/disable kicking AFK players.movePlayerToSpectator: true or false to move AFK players to spectator mode.afkMessage: The message displayed when a player goes AFK.Please check the AFK mod's folder for a config.lua or similar file to customize these settings. If no such file exists, the defaults are hardcoded.Configure ACL (Access Control List) - (If Specific Permissions are Needed):For the AFK mod itself, specific ACL entries are usually not required for basic functionality. However, if there are any admin commands associated with managing AFK players (e.g., a command to manually mark someone AFK or clear AFK status), you would need to ensure the appropriate admin groups have access to those commands in your acl.xml file.Refer to the MTA Wiki on ACL for detailed guidance.Start Your MTA Server:Launch your Multi Theft Auto server.The AFK mod should now be active and monitoring player activity!ü§ù How to ContributeWe welcome contributions!
